React | Django Starter Kit
========================
> starter code for a react/django project

This repository is for projects that use the [React](https://reactjs.org) framework for my frontend and the [Django](https://djangocentral.com) framework for my backend. 
I've created extensive documentation of resources I've used and may need for future projects.
I've also created a versioning system for improving a project after installation

:bulb: What if you could clone the repository "version" you want, for how far you want to build a project

:bulb: maybe I could create an api that installs the version that you want when building your project?

:bulb: say you choose lvl 3; lvl 3 will install all the packages/apis/frameworks/docs you need for a lvl 3 system. It will also include the mvp through lvl 2 checklist to guide you on building your project. lvl mvp is a dev grade app. lvl final is production grade app. When you install through commandline it walks you through customization and naming of files/packages/apps
