React/Django Starter Kit
========================
> starter code for a react/django project

This repository is for projects that use the [React](https://reactjs.org) framework for my frontend and the [Django](https://djangocentral.com) framework for my backend. 
I've created extensive documentation of resources I've used and may need for future projects.

> Resourced.md

I've also created a versioning system for improving a project after installation

> MVP.md
> Version1.md
