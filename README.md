React | Django Starter Kit
========================
> starter code for a react/django project

This repository is for projects that use the [React](https://reactjs.org) framework for my frontend and the [Django](https://djangocentral.com) framework for my backend. 
I've created extensive documentation of resources I've used and may need for future projects.
I've also created a versioning system for improving a project after installation

:bulb: What if you could clone the repository "version" you want, for how far you want to build a project
:bulb: maybe I could create an api that installs the version that you want when building your project?
