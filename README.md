Project Description
---

Descibe what project is about and its purpose. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas non libero nisi. Quisque ultricies, libero vulputate feugiat mollis, dui nulla venenatis sem, et semper enim leo vitae nulla. In et elementum arcu. Nam accumsan enim at aliquam interdum. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Morbi nec varius velit, ut sodales arcu. Suspendisse nec erat mattis elit accumsan gravida. Donec lacinia dignissim dignissim.

:bulb: What if you could clone the repository "version" you want, for how far you want to build a project
maybe I could create an api that installs the version that you want when building your project?
say you choose lvl 3; lvl 3 will install all the packages/apis/frameworks/docs you need for a lvl 3 system. It will also include the mvp through lvl 2 checklist to guide you on building your project. lvl mvp is a dev grade app. lvl final is production grade app. When you install through commandline it walks you through customization and naming of files/packages/apps
